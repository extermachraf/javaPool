## I - Overview
This module introduces fundamental Java programming concepts essential for solving both simple and complex business tasks. You will learn how to use primitive types, handle input/output operations, work with strings, and manipulate arrays. The exercises in this module focus on applying these concepts to solve practical problems, ensuring a solid foundation in Java.

## Objectives
- __Understand Primitive Types:__ Learn how to work with Java's eight primitive data types (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, double) and how they are used in business logic.
- __Input/Output Operations:__ Use standard input/output methods (System.out, System.err, Scanner) to interact with users and handle data.
- __Basic Algorithms:__ Implement simple algorithms using fundamental constructs like sequences, conditionals, loops, and standard operators to solve common problems.
- __String Manipulation:__ Work with strings efficiently, avoiding common pitfalls like excessive string concatenation in loops.
- __Array Operations:__ Understand how to work with arrays for storing and processing data. In some exercises, you'll explore alternatives to arrays when storing data.

By completing these exercises, you will develop a deeper understanding of Javaâ€™s core features and be better prepared to solve more complex problems in future modules.
