## I - Summary
This module aims to teach fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, alongside key operations with collections. By the end of the module, you will have modeled various collections and built a fully functional money transfer application. Through a series of exercises, you will learn how to apply OOP principles, use collections, and implement business logic for real-world use cases.

You will build an internal money transfer system. Users can transfer funds between each other, with each transaction stored as debit/credit pairs. The system must handle missing transaction entries and allow for transaction recovery.

## II - Learning Objectives

- Understand core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- Work with collections in Java, including arrays and linked lists.
- Develop a money transfer system with robust business logic and transaction handling.
- Implement unique identifiers, transaction management, and error handling using Java features.
