# Java Module 02 - IO Package & File Manipulation

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This module focuses on Java's input/output capabilities and file system manipulation. Through a series of practical exercises, you'll learn how to effectively work with Java's IO package, process files, analyze content, and build a functional file management system.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:
- Master Java's input/output stream classes
- Understand file signatures and binary file analysis
- Practice text analysis and similarity measurement
- Implement a functional file management system
- Gain hands-on experience with Java Collections API
- Learn file system navigation and manipulation techniques

## ðŸ“š Exercises

### Exercise 00: File Signatures

**Objective:** Build an application that can identify file types based on their binary signatures.

**Skills you'll develop:**
- Working with byte streams using InputStream and OutputStream
- Reading binary data from files
- Pattern matching with file signatures
- Processing and analyzing file headers

**Implementation requirements:**
- Create a signatures database with at least 10 different file formats
- Read file headers and compare them with signature patterns
- Output identification results to a result.txt file

### Exercise 01: Words

**Objective:** Create a text similarity analyzer using vector space models.

**Skills you'll develop:**
- Working with character streams using Reader and Writer
- Buffered reading for performance optimization
- Text tokenization and dictionary creation
- Vector calculations for similarity measurement
- Mathematical applications in text analysis

**Implementation requirements:**
- Parse and tokenize text documents
- Create frequency vectors based on a common dictionary
- Calculate cosine similarity between document vectors
- Generate output dictionary and similarity score

### Exercise 02: File Manager

**Objective:** Implement a command-line file manager with navigation and manipulation capabilities.

**Skills you'll develop:**
- Directory traversal and file system operations
- File size calculation and metadata extraction
- Command parsing and execution
- Path manipulation and validation
- Interactive console application design

**Implementation requirements:**
- Support for directory navigation (cd command)
- File listing with size information (ls command)
- File moving and renaming capabilities (mv command)
- Interactive command-line interface
